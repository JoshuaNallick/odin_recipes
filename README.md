# odin_recipes
This is one of the first projects within The Odin Project where I will utilize HTML &amp; CSS to create a website with recipes.

This project will develop a website for hosting recipes. There will be multiple pages that house the recipes through the use of ordered and unordered lists in HTML. I will first learn how to set the structure of the website with HTML and then return later on in the course to style with CSS.

This project will not only let me practice HTML & CSS, but it will get me repetition with using Git to commit and pull/push my code. Once this project is finished, I hope to have a more thorough understanding of using Git and my interactions with a repo on Github.
